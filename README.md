# Valve Server CVar Lists

Curated collection of server console variable (cvar) dumps for a wide range of Valve (GoldSrc / Source / Source 2) and community game servers. Each `*-cvarlist.txt` file contains the raw output of the `cvarlist` command captured shortly after a clean install and first launch of the dedicated server using [LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com/).

The goal is to provide a reproducible, versionâ€‘agnostic reference for:

- Auditing available server configuration options
- Change tracking between engine / game updates
- Tooling (parsing / docs generation / diffing)
- Quick lookups without spinning up a server

## Repository Contents

File naming pattern: `<shortname>-cvarlist.txt` where `shortname` matches the LinuxGSM server script prefix (e.g. `tf2server`).

Current lists:
